Should you believe everything you see on the internet?
What if we don't have a choice in whether or not to believe the things we see on our devices? 
What if we were required to use our devices to thrive in everyday life? 
For example, imagine renting an apartment. Is it possible to rent an apartment without using any digital technology?
What if the apartment rental website you are using to rent your apartment is setting the price based on your income level?
How would you even know that you are seeing a different price than what other people see?
